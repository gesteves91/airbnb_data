# airbnb_data
This repo contains data from two collections of Airbnb public data. One is inspired by AirbnbInside and the other one was a crawler developed by the main author (gesteves91). 

This data is emphasized in the dissertation produced by Geanderson in which gave birth to the PROMISE framework.

The regions selected by the study were: United States -> Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Europe -> Berlin, London and Paris. Asia -> Honk Kong. Australia -> Sydney. Brazil -> Belo Horizonte, SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre and Salvador.
